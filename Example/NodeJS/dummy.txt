This is a dummy file. 
We dont want this file to be included in our docker image 
so we will add this file in .dockerignore
.dockerignore is simply like .gitignore to ignore files

Apart from this, we have also created testcode1.txt and testcode2.txt
we can also add files with specific extension in .dockerignore
