- Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the management of multi-container Docker applications. 
- Instead of using long, complex Docker commands to start and manage containers, Docker Compose lets you define your application's services, networks, and volumes  
  in a single file called docker-compose.yml. 
- This file acts like a recipe for your entire application stack.

- In simple terms, Docker Compose helps you orchestrate multiple containers that work together as one application. You define what containers you need, how they 
  should interact, and any additional configurations, all in one easy-to-read YAML file.

Difference from Kubernetes:

Kubernetes is a more powerful orchestration tool, designed for large-scale container deployments. While Docker Compose is great for development and small to 
medium-sized projects, Kubernetes offers more advanced features like automatic scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates. Docker Compose is simpler and more 
straightforward, while Kubernetes is more complex but better suited for large-scale production environments.
